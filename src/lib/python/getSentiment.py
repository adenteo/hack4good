#        "VADER is smart, handsome, and funny.",  # positive sentence example
#        "VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!",  # punctuation emphasis handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)
#        "VADER is very smart, handsome, and funny.", # booster words handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)
#        "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.",  # emphasis for ALLCAPS handled
#        "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!", # combination of signals - VADER appropriately adjusts intensity
#        "VADER is VERY SMART, uber handsome, and FRIGGIN FUNNY!!!", # booster words & punctuation make this close to ceiling for score
#        "VADER is not smart, handsome, nor funny.",  # negation sentence example
#        "The book was good.",  # positive sentence
#        "At least it isn't a horrible book.",  # negated negative sentence with contraction
#        "The book was only kind of good.", # qualified positive sentence is handled correctly (intensity adjusted)
#        "The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.", # mixed negation sentence
#        "Today SUX!",  # negative slang with capitalization emphasis
#        "Today only kinda sux! But I'll get by, lol", # mixed sentiment example with slang and constrastive conjunction "but"
#        "Make sure you :) or :D today!",  # emoticons handled
#        "Catch utf-8 emoji such as such as üíò and üíã and üòÅ",  # emojis handled
#        "Not bad at all"  # Capitalized negation
